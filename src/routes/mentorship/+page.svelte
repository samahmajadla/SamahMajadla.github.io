    While I love full-stack development, I am not professionally experienced in front-end development. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Studio Art, and Masters of Science in Computer Science. My preferred programming language is Java, and I have experience in others and am able to adapt to most languages. I am currently working on a full-stack application for Prison Books Collective, a non-profit that sends free books to individuals incarcerated in North Carolina and Alabama; the app is being developed using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA, MySQL, SvelteKit, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
