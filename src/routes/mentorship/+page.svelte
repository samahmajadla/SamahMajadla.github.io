		<p>
			<b>Cole Wyman</b> - I studied Materials Science & Engineering and Computer Science at
			University of Michigan for a few years before deciding to leave college and begin working. I
			bopped around between freelance jobs doing frontend and mobile web development to varying
			degrees of success before finally landing my first software engineering role at a consultancy.
			In the years since, I’ve been able to grow a lot in my role and hone my skills in distributed
			systems, code cleanliness, and frontend development.
			<br />
			<br />
			As someone whose career was made possible by the willingness of my friends and colleagues to give
			me a chance despite a lack of formal accreditation, mentorship has always been an important means
			for me to give back to the community and lift up other talented, hard-working individuals that
			haven’t had that same fortune of circumstance. I believe anyone with drive and desire can succeed
			in this field and I hope to be able to help elevate new technologists in their career goals.
			<br />
			<br />
			Outside of work, I’m a fan of food, artsy stuff, and comedy. As a Detroiter living in NYC, I have
			great access to all three, and I love getting the chance to bring my friends and family around
			for Broadway shows and Korean BBQ.
