I'm currently a cybersecurity analyst that specializes in response / defense (e.g. finding the attackers and helping my clients stop them, and prevent such things from happening in the future), with about 8 years in IT / security at this point. My favorite things to do work-wise are working on incidents and helping teach/mentor new analysts! I have a maths degree which I got as a personal joke (because I'm terrible at math) and am primarily self-taught when it comes to IT/security. In my free time, I still enjoy discussing security and also like poetry / spiders / biology (pic is me with a pacific banana slug). In a few years I'll probably work in some sort of leadership capacity and am preparing myself so that I can be a good human in that capacity."},{name:"Mari",current:!0,img:"mari.jpg",alt:"",bio:'Hello! My name is Mari and I work in game development. My current role is a Product Manager for mobile games, with a specialization in live operations. Never heard of it? You can learn more about it <a href="https://videohub.inspiring-girls.com/en/videos/mari-yalong">here!</a> <br> While seemingly an odd concoction of backgrounds, they all somehow led me here, to my dream job in an industry very near and dear to my life. Both during and after college, I worked various roles in hospitality and marketing, while pursuing my degree in economics. Weirdly enough, that\u2019s exactly the skill set needed in live operations: analysis, a curiosity of human behavior, and event and monetization planning. <br> I work with an array of teams across development, design, art, QA, community, and more, while looking at data tools to determine the best plans of action moving forward. <br> <br> While I\u2019m not sitting at my desk, I enjoy sitting at my other desk to play Minecraft or sitting at the living room playing couch co-op games like Army of Two. <br> <br> When I\u2019m not sitting, I\u2019m playing volleyball, lifting at the gym, bowling, or going on random walks that always end up in a foodie trip.'},{name:"Samah Majadla",current:!0,img:"samah_headshot_small.jpeg",alt:"Samah smiling for the camera",bio:`I have a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Studio Art, and
