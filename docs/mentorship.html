	adapt to most languages. I am currently working on a full-stack application for Prison Books
	Collective, a non-profit that sends free books to individuals incarcerated in North Carolina and
	Alabama; the app is being developed using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA, MySQL, SvelteKit,
	HTML, Javascript, and CSS. You can learn more <a href="/about">about my background here.</a></p>

	session with you. Selected mentees will be notified by October 15, 2022. We encourage you to provide as much detail in your application as you can, as this helps us understand you, your needs and hopes for this program, and best assess your fit with us.
