			University of Michigan for a few years before deciding to leave college and begin working. I
			bopped around between freelance jobs doing frontend and mobile web development to varying
			degrees of success before finally landing my first software engineering role at a consultancy.
			In the years since, I’ve been able to grow a lot in my role and hone my skills in distributed
			systems, code cleanliness, and frontend development.

			As someone whose career was made possible by the willingness of my friends and colleagues to give
			me a chance despite a lack of formal accreditation, mentorship has always been an important means
			for me to give back to the community and lift up other talented, hard-working individuals that
			haven’t had that same fortune of circumstance. I believe anyone with drive and desire can succeed
			in this field and I hope to be able to help elevate new technologists in their career goals.
		
			Outside of work, I’m a fan of food, artsy stuff, and comedy. As a Detroiter living in NYC, I have
			great access to all three, and I love getting the chance to bring my friends and family around
			for Broadway shows and Korean BBQ.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></span></div>

I was one of those kids who went through a bunch of different majors in college, settled on Mechanical Engineering, and then wound up back in software somehow! I was recently promoted to manage a software engineering team called FordLabs (check us out! www.fordlabs.com). These days I'm still working on learning about the usual things that come with management, leadership strategies, a bit of bureaucracy, and figuring out how to best help my team. When I get to jump in the code, I love experimenting with little ideas that can help make the big idea go. Sometimes I just experiment with huge ideas for the fun of it. On my off time I love getting out and doing things. I have niche hobbies like ballroom dance and speedskating, but also enjoy more typical things like art, running, and watching sports (go blue!).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></span></div>
